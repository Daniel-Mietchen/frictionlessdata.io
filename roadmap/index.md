Work on the fundamental technology supporting Frictionless Data has been in development since November 2007.  Over the next two years, we are looking to profoundly move this vision forward.  Read on for an overview of current roadmap for the second half of 2016. If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to [contact us](/get-involved#contact).

## 2016 

“Core” Frictionless Data [tooling and libraries](/tools/) are being written in JavaScript and Python, the most common languages used in the open data sector.  Likewise, our [standards](/standards/) are specified in [JSON](http://json.org/).  We are also looking to work with others to build libraries in other target languages. For example, we would like to see Data Package libraries in popular languages like Go, Java, Clojure and PHP.  If you are a developer interested in contributing, please [get involved](/get-involved/).
