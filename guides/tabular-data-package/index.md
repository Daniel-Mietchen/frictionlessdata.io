Tabular Data Package is a "profile" of the Data Package standard.  As
its name implies, Tabular Data Package is designed to contain data
that exists in tables.  The standard requires its tabular data to be
stored in well-formatted CSV files and enforces this through a
JSON-based schema description language called
[JSON Table Schema](/guides/json-table-schema/).
