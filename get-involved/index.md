title: Get Involved
---

Frictionless Data is a major project of [Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org/) which started as a *community-driven* effort of [Open Knowledge Labs](http://okfnlabs.org).  Community building continues to be a core component of the project: **anyone can get involved and contributions are very welcome**.

In order to make creating, using, and sharing data as easy and frictionless as possible, we need **concrete use cases** and **feedback** from people working across a variety of data-intensive fields:

- Are you a researcher that needs a specific [tool or integration with your existing software]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) to do your work more effectively?  
- Are you a developer working on tooling and have features that our [standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/) should support?

[Let us know](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/frictionless-data).  We’d love to hear about it.  For examples of what has already been built, see the [tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) page.  For information on where we’re going, see our [roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/). 

We're also [looking for volunteer "curators"](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/01/03/data-curators-wanted-for-core-datasets.html) interested in helping us create a set of high quality, useful datasets published as Data Packages.

## Contact

If you're not sure where to start, there are lots of ways to get in contact with the core team members as well as the broader community around Frictionless Data:  

### Forum

If you have a use case that you'd like to see Data Packages support, including integration with a particular tool or file format, leave a note in the [forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/frictionless-data).

### Chat

We also have a [chat room](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat) dedicated to technical discussion about Frictionless Data.  Feel free to stop by and introduce yourself.

### GitHub

All code developed in support of this project is hosted on the [frictionlessdata](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/) organization on GitHub.  Comments, forks, and pull requests welcome.
